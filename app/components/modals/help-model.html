  <h2>Epsilon-Prime</h2>

  <p />In Epsilon-prime your goal is to conquer the planet of ε-prime. You do this by commanding an army of bots to explore and exploit the resources of ε-prime. You can control your bots individually using your mouse and keyboard or by writing command scripts in JavaScript. The game begins with a simple (and very inefficient) set of scripts for exploring and collecting resources. Using just these scripts you could complete the game in ~2,500 turns. But you can you do better!

  <p />Epsilon-Prime is a personal project and under active development. It is playable now, however, many things are likely to be broken or change in a future version. Player and developer feedback is appreciated... and needed. If you like the game or the idea please give feedback or encouragement (<a href="https://gitter.im/Hypercubed/Epsilon-Prime?utm_source=badge&amp;utm_medium=badge&amp;utm_campaign=pr-badge">Gitter chat</a>). Please report them using <a href="https://github.com/Hypercubed/Epsilon-Prime/issues">GitHub issues</a>.  The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/Hypercubed/Epsilon-Prime">GitHub</a>.
