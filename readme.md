# Epsilon-Prime

Epsilon-prime is inspired by the classic 4x game Empire.  In ε-prime a player will control units to εXplore a procedurally generated world (called ε-prime), εXploit the resource of ε-prime in order to εXpand their army of bots and eventually conquer (εXterminate?) the planet ε-prime.  The player uses units (or bots), controlled either manually or via JavaScript command scripts, to manage energy use and collect resources from the ε-prime environment.  These resources are used to create new units or upgrade existing units.  The players goal is to collect resources in the most efficient manner possible.

## Development status
Epsilon-Prime is a personal project and under active development.  It is playable now (at http://hypercubed.github.io/Epsilon-Prime/), however, many things are likely to be broken or change in a future version.  Player and developer feedback is appreciated... and needed.  If you like the game or the idea please give feedback or encouragement.
