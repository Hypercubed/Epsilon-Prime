# Welcome to Epsilon-Prime

In Epsilon-prime your goal is to conquer the planet of ε-prime. You do this by commanding an army of bots to explore and exploit the resources of ε-prime. You can control your bots individually using your mouse and keyboard or by writing command scripts in JavaScript. The game begins with a simple (and very inefficient) set of scripts for exploring and collecting resources.  If you need help follow the tutorial.  Using just these scripts you could complete the demo in <5,000 turns. But you can you do better; and, in the future, the game will become more challenging.

Epsilon-Prime is a personal project and under active development. It is playable now, however, many things are likely to be broken or change in a future version. Player and developer feedback is appreciated... and needed. If you like the game or the idea please give feedback or encouragement ([Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/Hypercubed/Epsilon-Prime?utm_source=badge&amp;utm_medium=badge&amp;utm_campaign=pr-badge)). Please report issues using [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Hypercubed/Epsilon-Prime/issues).  The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Hypercubed/Epsilon-Prime).
